# <u>Refinement Plan and Code Review</u>
The code review will be a chance for me to show the different types of programs I was able to complete throughout my time at SNHU and be able to design, develop, and deliver professional-quality oral, written, and visual communications that are coherent, technically sound, and appropriately adapted to specific audiences and contexts

## Software Design/Engineering
For the first category of Software Engineering/Design I plan to work on the Weight Tracker application, which is an Android based mobile application. This project originated from the CS360 Mobile Architect and Programming course that I took. I would like to enhance the login capabilities of the application and work more on improving the design of the application in terms of being able to record weights and set goal weights more efficiently. This will display skills gained by making the mobile app more user-friendly and improving the overall design of the application. This will show skills in Android Studio IDE, with a proficiency in the JAVA programming language as well as some SQLite databases. The specific outcome that I am aiming for with this is: Demonstrate an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals. 

<u>Pseudocode: </u>
1.	Improve the functionality of the database.
2.	Add the ability to login to an account.
3.	Improve the functionality of the database to list weight inputs and goals.

## Algorithms and Data Structures
For the Algorithm and Data Structures I would like to also look into enhancing the Weight Tracker application from CS360 Mobile Architect and Programming course that I took. I would like to enhance the data structures to be able to store inputs over a long period of time and would like to enhance the table into a graphical representation of the data. This feels like a better approach to someone who is tracking their weight to have a graph instead of a table. This will require more JAVA programming language. This will show skills that represent the ability to store data within data structures and create something useful with this data to solve a problem. This will produce the outcome to design and evaluate computing solutions that solve a given problem using algorithmic principles and computer science practices and standards appropriate to its solution, while managing the trade-offs involved in design choices.

<u>Pseudocode: </u>
1.	Improve data input and storage.
2.	Enhance how the data is represented. 

## Databases
For the Databases portion of the ePortfolio I plan to enhance the Salvare Search for Rescue App which I made during the CS340 Client/Server Development course that I took. This is one of the best applications that I made during the course of my time at SNHU in my opinion. Therefore, it is going to be harder to enhance, but I am up for the challenge. There could be some enhancements to make within the dashboard of the application and how well it locates the different animals. This application was written in Python along with the combination of MongoDB, so this would show skills of another programming language besides the JAVA that was used in the first two examples. This will address the outcome in order to employ strategies for building collaborative environments that enable diverse audiences to support organizational decision making in the field of computer science. 

<u>Pseudocode: </u>
1.	Enhance the dashboard of the database.
2.	Establish more functionality of the database.
