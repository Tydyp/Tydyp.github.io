# <u>Enhancement Three</u>

## Databases
This artifact is from CS 340, Client/Server Development. This artifact was created about a year ago in August 2022. This application was written in Python along with the combination of MongoDB, so this would show skills of another programming language besides the JAVA that was used in the first two examples. This will address the outcome in order to employ strategies for building collaborative environments that enable diverse audiences to support organizational decision making in the field of computer science. 
	I believe that the course objectives that I planned on meeting are met within this enhancement in Module One. I learned a lot on the initial creation of the project, which taught me a lot about databases. I learned a lot about how to use MongoDB in conjunction with Python to create a database with many different filtering options. It also showed me how to include a graph as well as a geolocation chart as well within the dashboard which was very interactive with the database of different animals. I faced a lot of challenges with improving this artifact because I felt that it was already very well made and functioned very well. So, making smaller incremental enhancements to the artifact was more challenging. I think overall this is the best artifact in the ePortfolio that showcases the most outcomes as a whole. 

## Video of the Dashboard
Below is a video displaying the dashboard that I created which shows the different capabilities of the dashboard.
