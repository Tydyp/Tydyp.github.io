# <u>Enhancement Two</u>

## Algorithms and Data Structures

This artifact is from CS 360, Mobile Architecture and Programming, and it is a weight tracker application created on the Android platform. This application would take inputs from the user and track them on a table. This application was created about a year ago, in December 2022. 
	I selected this item for the ePortfolio because it represents an understanding of mobile programming of applications, which is more up to date with today since a lot more people are accessing things on their mobile phones than ever before. So, understanding mobile programming showcases the skill of being able to create applications on mobile platforms as well as the standard platform, showcasing a great skill in algorithms and data structures where the user will input different data into the application. This artifact was improved by enhancing the way the user interacted with entering in their data for daily weights as well as goal weights. It was also enhanced by the way it is able to depict the data back to the user over a period of time.  I believe that the course objectives that I planned on meeting are met within this enhancement in Module One. I learned a lot on the initial creation of the project, which was how to design and engineer something as big as an android application. It taught me a lot about data structures and algorithms where the user had an input that needed to be recorded and stored over time. Improving upon it also taught me a lot more about how the programmer could make it more accessible and user friendly. The biggest challenge of this enhancement was finding an improvement on data entry and an improvement in how the data is represented that a user could follow along with easily.
