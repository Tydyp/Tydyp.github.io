# Enhancement One

## Software Engineering/Design

For Software Engineering/Design I plan to work on the Weight Tracker application, which is an Android based mobile application. This project originated from the CS360 Mobile Architect and Programming course that I took. I would like to enhance the login capabilities of the application and work more on improving the design of the application in terms of being able to record weights and set goal weights more efficiently. This will display skills gained by making the mobile app more user-friendly and improving the overall design of the application. This will show skills in Android Studio IDE, with a proficiency in the JAVA programming language as well as some SQLite databases. The specific outcome that I am aiming for with this is: Demonstrate an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals.
