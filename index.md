### <u>Professional Self-Assessment</u>
Throughout my career at SNHU I developed the skills necessary to create and develop collaborative environments that enable diverse audiences to support the organizational decision making in the field of computer science. Create this ePortfolio helped to showcase my abilities to program and develop diffferent applications to solve a variety of different problems. I learned a lot about team environments and the different types of developmental processes such as Waterfall and Agile development methods. I learned about communicating to stakeholders throughout these development processes and how valuable stakeholder and customer feedback can be in the development process. I learned a lot about data structures and algorithms through classes that taught me languages such as python and java in classes like Mobile Architecture and Programming. I learned more about software engineering in a class that was called Software Reverse Engineering, which showed how to take C++ code and convert it into assembly and then binary. This taught me a lot about security as well, and why it is a very bad idea to hard-code any sort of secure information into a program. One of my favorite languages that I learned throughout my time at SNHU was SQL, which is a big lanuage for working with databases. I chose to use artifacts from CS360 Mobile Architecture and Programming and from CS340 Client/Server Development. These two programs display my wide range of abilities to work with multiple languages as well as showing competency with solving different problems faced by different companies.
